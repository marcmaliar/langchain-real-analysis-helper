# LangChain helps the user understand the probability of a poker hand

This project is a LangChain prompt engineering application. It is WORK-IN-PROGRESS. The vision for this project is to load a bunch of real analysis math html files from a website, extract their info using Beautiful Soup LangChain HTML loader, break the material into chunks, and use ChatOpenAI to interact with the math material. I will try to restrict ChatOpenAI from using its own knowledge of real analysis and instead use just the documents. Can it come up with proofs? Let's find out.
